/**
 * Abstract base class for GUI components requiring lifecycle management and navigation hierarchy integration.
 * <p>
 * This class provides a standardized framework for managing GUI component lifecycles within the airport
 * management system's navigation hierarchy. It defines essential contracts for resource cleanup, state
 * restoration, and frame access that enable proper navigation flow and memory management throughout
 * the application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The DisposableObject class supports comprehensive lifecycle management including:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Resource Disposal:</strong> Standardized cleanup procedures for component resources and state</li>
 *   <li><strong>State Restoration:</strong> Component state recovery for navigation return scenarios</li>
 *   <li><strong>Navigation Integration:</strong> Seamless integration with application navigation hierarchy</li>
 *   <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Proper resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks</li>
 *   <li><strong>Frame Access:</strong> Standardized access to component's main window frame</li>
 *   <li><strong>Controller Integration:</strong> Consistent controller resource management across components</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The class serves as the foundation for all major GUI components in the application including:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Booking Interfaces:</strong> {@link BookingPage}, {@link BookingPageAdmin}, {@link BookingPageCustomer}</li>
 *   <li><strong>Home Pages:</strong> {@link HomePageAdmin}, {@link HomePageCustomer}</li>
 *   <li><strong>Search Interfaces:</strong> {@link SearchFlightCustomerMainFrame}, {@link MyBookingsCustomerMainFrame}</li>
 *   <li><strong>Authentication Screens:</strong> {@link LogInScreen}, {@link RegisterScreen}</li>
 *   <li><strong>Specialized Interfaces:</strong> {@link CheckinPassengers}, {@link BookingModifyPage}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Navigation hierarchy management enables the application to maintain a stack of active components,
 * supporting complex navigation patterns including forward navigation, backward navigation, and
 * component replacement while ensuring proper resource management at each transition.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Resource disposal follows a standardized pattern where components clean up their allocated resources,
 * dispose of child components, reset controller state when appropriate, and prepare for garbage
 * collection. This ensures that navigation operations do not accumulate memory leaks over time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * State restoration enables components to recover their operational state when returning from
 * navigation operations. This is particularly important for search interfaces, user session
 * management, and maintaining user workflow continuity across navigation operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The abstract nature of this class ensures that all GUI components implement essential lifecycle
 * methods while providing flexibility for component-specific resource management and state
 * handling requirements.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Integration with the {@link Controller} system ensures that component lifecycle operations
 * are properly coordinated with business logic, data persistence, and system state management
 * throughout the application's operational lifetime.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thread safety is not provided as GUI components are accessed from the Event Dispatch Thread.
 * Component implementations should ensure that lifecycle operations are performed on the
 * appropriate thread to maintain Swing threading requirements.
 * </p>

public abstract class DisposableObject {

    /**
     * Performs component-specific resource cleanup and disposal operations.
     * <p>
     * This method is called when a component is being removed from the navigation hierarchy
     * and needs to clean up its allocated resources. The default implementation provides
     * no operation, allowing components to override this method only when specific cleanup
     * is required.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Common disposal operations include:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><strong>Resource Cleanup:</strong> Disposing of allocated GUI components, dialogs, and windows</li>
     *   <li><strong>Controller State Management:</strong> Clearing or resetting controller data when appropriate</li>
     *   <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Releasing references to large objects and collections</li>
     *   <li><strong>Cache Clearing:</strong> Removing cached data that is no longer needed</li>
     *   <li><strong>Event Listener Removal:</strong> Unregistering event listeners to prevent memory leaks</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The method receives the complete navigation hierarchy through the callingObjects parameter,
     * enabling components to perform cleanup operations that may require interaction with
     * parent or sibling components in the navigation stack.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Controller integration allows components to perform business logic cleanup operations
     * such as clearing search caches, resetting temporary data, or updating persistent
     * state as appropriate for the component's role in the application.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Implementation examples include:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><strong>Search Interfaces:</strong> Clear search result caches and reset search state</li>
     *   <li><strong>Booking Pages:</strong> Dispose passenger panels, seat choosers, and luggage views</li>
     *   <li><strong>Home Pages:</strong> Reset user session data and clear temporary display data</li>
     *   <li><strong>Administrative Interfaces:</strong> Reset flight and booking controller state</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The method should be designed to be safe for multiple invocations and should handle
     * null references gracefully to ensure robust cleanup behavior regardless of component state.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param callingObjects the list of parent objects in the application navigation hierarchy for cleanup coordination
     * @param controller the system controller for business logic cleanup and state management

    /**
     * Performs component-specific state restoration operations when returning to this component.
     * <p>
     * This method is called when a component becomes active again after being hidden or
     * replaced in the navigation hierarchy. The default implementation provides no operation,
     * allowing components to override this method only when specific restoration is required.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Common restoration operations include:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><strong>Data Refresh:</strong> Updating displayed information with current system state</li>
     *   <li><strong>User Session Validation:</strong> Verifying and updating user authentication state</li>
     *   <li><strong>Search State Recovery:</strong> Restoring previous search results and criteria</li>
     *   <li><strong>Display Synchronization:</strong> Ensuring displayed data reflects current system state</li>
     *   <li><strong>Component Revalidation:</strong> Refreshing component layout and visual state</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The method receives the complete navigation hierarchy through the callingObjects parameter,
     * enabling components to perform restoration operations that may require coordination with
     * other components in the navigation stack.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Controller integration allows components to access current system state and perform
     * business logic operations necessary to restore proper component functionality after
     * periods of inactivity or navigation away from the component.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Implementation examples include:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><strong>Search Interfaces:</strong> Re-execute previous searches and restore result displays</li>
     *   <li><strong>Home Pages:</strong> Refresh flight tables and update user greeting information</li>
     *   <li><strong>User Interfaces:</strong> Validate current user session and update user-specific displays</li>
     *   <li><strong>Data Displays:</strong> Refresh table data and update dynamic content</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The restoration process should be designed to handle cases where the underlying system
     * state may have changed during navigation, ensuring that the component displays current
     * and accurate information upon restoration.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Performance considerations should be taken into account, as restoration operations may
     * involve database queries or network operations that could impact user experience if
     * not handled efficiently.
     * </p>

    /**
     * Provides access to the component's main window frame for navigation and display management.
     * <p>
     * This abstract method must be implemented by all concrete subclasses to return their
     * primary {@link JFrame} instance. The frame serves as the main window for the component
     * and is used by the navigation system for window management operations including sizing,
     * positioning, visibility control, and disposal.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Frame access enables the navigation system to perform essential window management
     * operations including:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><strong>Visibility Control:</strong> Showing and hiding windows during navigation transitions</li>
     *   <li><strong>Size Management:</strong> Retrieving and setting window dimensions for consistent display</li>
     *   <li><strong>Position Management:</strong> Managing window screen position for user experience continuity</li>
     *   <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Handling window maximization and minimization states</li>
     *   <li><strong>Disposal Operations:</strong> Properly disposing of windows during component cleanup</li>
     *   <li><strong>Title Management:</strong> Accessing window titles for navigation logic and user feedback</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The returned frame should be the primary window associated with the component that
     * users interact with directly. For components with multiple windows, this should be
     * the main or parent window that represents the component in the navigation hierarchy.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Navigation operations rely on frame access to maintain consistent user experience
     * across component transitions, including preserving window size and position when
     * navigating between components and ensuring proper window state management.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The frame reference should remain constant throughout the component's lifecycle,
     * as navigation operations may cache frame references for performance optimization
     * and state management purposes.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Implementation should ensure that the returned frame is properly initialized and
     * configured before being returned, as navigation operations may immediately perform
     * operations on the returned frame reference.
     * </p>
