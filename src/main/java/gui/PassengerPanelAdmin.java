/**
 * Administrative passenger information panel with enhanced check-in capabilities for airport management operations.
 * <p>
 * This class extends {@link PassengerPanel} to provide specialized administrative functionality for managing
 * passenger data within administrative contexts, particularly during check-in operations and flight
 * management workflows. The panel maintains all standard passenger management capabilities while adding
 * administrative-specific features including enhanced check-in controls and operational oversight functions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The PassengerPanelAdmin class supports comprehensive administrative passenger management including:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Enhanced Check-in Controls:</strong> Administrative check-in checkbox with specialized positioning and functionality</li>
 *   <li><strong>Inherited Passenger Management:</strong> Complete passenger information handling from the parent class</li>
 *   <li><strong>Administrative Integration:</strong> Specialized integration with administrative workflows and operational systems</li>
 *   <li><strong>Operational Oversight:</strong> Enhanced visibility and control for administrative staff during passenger operations</li>
 *   <li><strong>Batch Processing Support:</strong> Interactive selection capabilities for batch check-in and operational workflows</li>
 *   <li><strong>Administrative Context:</strong> Specialized behavior optimized for administrative interface requirements</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The interface is designed with administrative workflow optimization, providing operational staff with:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Consistent Passenger Interface:</strong> Familiar passenger information display inherited from the base class</li>
 *   <li><strong>Administrative Controls:</strong> Specialized check-in controls positioned for optimal administrative access</li>
 *   <li><strong>Operational Integration:</strong> Seamless integration with administrative workflows and batch processing operations</li>
 *   <li><strong>Professional Layout:</strong> GridBagLayout-based organization maintaining consistency with parent class design</li>
 *   <li><strong>Visual Consistency:</strong> Coherent design patterns that integrate with broader administrative interface systems</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Inheritance architecture leverages the complete {@link PassengerPanel} functionality while extending
 * specific administrative capabilities. The class maintains full compatibility with all parent class
 * methods and properties while providing specialized administrative enhancements that support
 * operational workflows and staff requirements.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Check-in functionality enhancement provides specialized check-in checkbox implementation that
 * extends the parent class capabilities with administrative-specific positioning and behavior.
 * The check-in controls integrate with batch processing workflows and operational management
 * systems for efficient passenger processing during flight operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Administrative integration includes specialized behavior for administrative contexts including
 * enhanced state management, operational coordination, and integration with administrative
 * workflow systems. The panel provides administrative staff with the tools necessary for
 * efficient passenger management during operational procedures.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Layout management maintains consistency with the parent class GridBagLayout architecture
 * while providing specialized positioning for administrative controls. The check-in checkbox
 * is positioned in row 3 spanning the full panel width for optimal administrative access
 * and clear visual separation from passenger information display.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Operational workflow support includes integration with administrative systems for batch
 * processing, passenger selection, and operational coordination. The panel enables efficient
 * administrative workflows during check-in operations, flight management, and passenger
 * oversight procedures throughout airport operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Constructor delegation ensures complete initialization through the parent class constructor
 * while maintaining administrative context. The delegation provides access to all passenger
 * management capabilities while establishing the foundation for administrative-specific
 * functionality and operational integration requirements.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * State management includes inherited passenger information state handling with enhanced
 * administrative state coordination. The panel maintains consistency with parent class
 * behavior while providing additional state management for administrative controls and
 * operational workflow coordination throughout administrative operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class integrates seamlessly with the broader airport management system through consistent
 * usage within administrative interfaces including {@link CheckinPassengers}, {@link BookingPageAdmin},
 * and other administrative workflow systems while maintaining clean separation of concerns
 * and reusable design patterns optimized for administrative requirements.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Visual design maintains consistency with the overall administrative interface aesthetic
 * through inherited styling from the parent class while providing specialized administrative
 * controls that integrate seamlessly with administrative interface requirements and
 * operational workflow patterns throughout the airport management system.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Resource management follows the inherited component lifecycle patterns with proper component
 * initialization, event handler setup, and integration with administrative interface layouts
 * for optimal performance and memory utilization during extended administrative operations
 * and passenger management workflows.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class serves as a specialized administrative component throughout the airport management
 * system, providing enhanced passenger management capabilities specifically optimized for
 * administrative workflows while maintaining full compatibility with standard passenger
 * management operations and interface requirements.

     * Layout integration ensures that the administrative check-in checkbox is properly
     * integrated within the inherited GridBagLayout structure while maintaining visual
     * consistency with parent class design patterns and administrative interface requirements
     * throughout the airport management system.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Operational coordination enables the checkbox to integrate with administrative workflow
     * systems for batch processing operations, passenger selection coordination, and
     * operational management throughout check-in procedures and flight management operations
     * within the administrative interface ecosystem.
