/**
 * Customer flight search interface providing comprehensive flight search and booking capabilities for the airport management system.
 * <p>
 * This class extends {@link DisposableObject} to provide a dedicated customer interface for flight
 * search and booking operations within the airport management system. The interface offers comprehensive
 * flight search functionality, real-time availability checking, and direct booking initiation through
 * an intuitive interface designed specifically for customer self-service operations and travel planning.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The SearchFlightCustomerMainFrame class supports comprehensive customer flight operations including:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Flight Search Functionality:</strong> Advanced search capabilities with multiple criteria including routes, dates, and times</li>
 *   <li><strong>Real-time Availability:</strong> Current flight availability and seat information display with dynamic updates</li>
 *   <li><strong>Booking Integration:</strong> Direct booking initiation from search results with seamless workflow transitions</li>
 *   <li><strong>Customer Navigation:</strong> Integrated navigation controls for accessing different customer areas and functions</li>
 *   <li><strong>User Session Management:</strong> Current customer information display and account management integration</li>
 *   <li><strong>Menu-Based Access:</strong> Support for customer menu navigation and direct interface access patterns</li>
 *   <li><strong>State Restoration:</strong> Advanced state management for maintaining search results and interface continuity</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The interface is designed with customer workflow optimization, providing users with:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Comprehensive Search Interface:</strong> Advanced flight search with route-based, temporal, and availability filtering options</li>
 *   <li><strong>Intuitive Navigation:</strong> Seamless integration with application navigation hierarchy and customer menu systems</li>
 *   <li><strong>Professional Presentation:</strong> Clean, organized layout with consistent airport management system branding</li>
 *   <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Adaptive interface that maintains functionality across different screen configurations</li>
 *   <li><strong>Context Preservation:</strong> Intelligent state management that preserves search results during navigation operations</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Layout architecture utilizes {@link GridBagLayout} for precise component positioning and optimal
 * space utilization. The interface maintains a structured five-section layout with title branding,
 * navigation controls, customer menu access, user information display, and comprehensive flight search
 * functionality in the main content area.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Flight search integration provides sophisticated search capabilities through the {@link SearchFlightPanel}
 * component, enabling customers to locate available flights using various criteria including origin/destination
 * cities, travel dates, departure times, and seat availability. The search functionality includes result
 * caching and state persistence for optimal user experience during navigation operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Navigation integration includes comprehensive customer navigation controls through the {@link NavigatorBarPanel}
 * and customer-specific menu functionality through the {@link MenuPanelCustomer} component. The navigation
 * supports seamless transitions between different customer areas while maintaining flight search context
 * and enabling efficient travel planning workflows.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * User session management displays current customer information through the {@link UserPanel} component,
 * providing account access, session management, and customer-specific functionality. The integration
 * ensures that flight search results are properly associated with the authenticated customer session
 * for booking operations and travel history management.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * State management includes sophisticated restoration capabilities that maintain search results, filter
 * settings, and interface state across navigation operations. The system automatically restores previous
 * flight search operations and results when customers return to the flight search interface from booking
 * or other customer management areas.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The interface supports both direct navigation access and menu-initiated access patterns, providing
 * flexibility for different customer workflows. The interface integrates seamlessly with customer
 * booking workflows, enabling smooth transitions from flight search to booking management operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Resource management follows the disposable object pattern with proper cleanup of search result caches
 * and flight data during navigation transitions. This ensures optimal system performance and maintains
 * customer privacy through proper session management and data cleanup procedures.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class integrates seamlessly with the broader airport management system through the {@link Controller}
 * interface, ensuring proper data access, business logic execution, and system state coordination throughout
 * customer flight search and booking operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Visual design maintains consistency with the overall airport management system aesthetic through
 * standardized colors, fonts, and component styling. The interface uses professional design elements
 * optimized for customer self-service operations and public interface requirements.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Window management includes minimum size constraints (1420x1080) to ensure optimal functionality across
 * different display configurations while maintaining interface usability and component accessibility
 * throughout customer flight search and booking workflows.
