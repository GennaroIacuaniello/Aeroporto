 * flight search operations, and booking management capabilities.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Navigation functionality includes intelligent duplicate prevention that checks current interface
 * state before initiating navigation transitions. This prevents unnecessary interface reloads
 * and ensures smooth customer workflow continuity throughout system operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Flight search integration provides direct access to the {@link SearchFlightCustomerMainFrame} component,
 * enabling customers to quickly access comprehensive flight search capabilities including route
 * planning, schedule checking, and booking initiation from any customer interface context.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Booking management integration includes access to the {@link MyBookingsCustomerMainFrame} component
 * for comprehensive booking overview and management capabilities. This integration enables
 * customers to quickly access their booking history, modify existing reservations, and manage
 * travel plans directly from the customer menu.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The panel integrates seamlessly with the broader customer interface ecosystem including
 * {@link HomePageCustomer}, {@link NavigatorBarPanel}, and other customer components while
 * maintaining clean separation of concerns and reusable design patterns.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Visual design maintains consistency with the overall airport management system aesthetic
 * through standardized button styling, popup menu presentation, and layout integration that
 * supports both standalone operation and integration within larger customer interfaces.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Resource management follows standard Swing component lifecycle patterns with proper component
 * initialization, event handler setup, and memory-efficient popup menu creation that supports
 * extended customer sessions without performance degradation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class serves as a primary navigation hub for customer operations, providing
 * consistent access patterns and interface behavior that support efficient customer
 * workflows and operational continuity throughout the airport management system.

    /**
     * Constructs a new MenuPanelCustomer with comprehensive customer menu functionality.
     * <p>
     * This constructor initializes the complete customer menu interface by creating
     * the menu button, configuring available customer options, and establishing
     * comprehensive event handling for all customer functions. The constructor
     * creates a fully functional customer menu ready for immediate use with
     * integrated navigation, interface management, and system coordination capabilities.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The initialization process includes:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><strong>Menu Button Creation:</strong> Primary menu button with Italian "Menù" label for customer access</li>
     *   <li><strong>Option Configuration:</strong> Dynamic list of customer functions including navigation and specialized tools</li>
     *   <li><strong>Event Handler Setup:</strong> Comprehensive popup menu creation and item selection handling</li>
     *   <li><strong>Navigation Integration:</strong> Intelligent navigation with duplicate prevention and state management</li>
     *   <li><strong>Interface Coordination:</strong> Seamless integration with specialized customer interfaces</li>
     *   <li><strong>Layout Integration:</strong> Proper panel integration and component visibility management</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Menu button creation establishes the primary user interaction point with Italian
     * localization ("Menù") for customer interface consistency. The button serves
     * as the trigger for the dynamic popup menu system and maintains standard Swing
     * button behavior and styling throughout customer operations.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Option configuration includes creating a dynamic list of customer functions:
     * "Home" for system navigation, "Cerca voli" (Search Flights) for flight search operations,
     * and "Le mie prenotazioni" (My Bookings) for booking management. The dynamic list
     * architecture supports future expansion and modification of customer functions.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Event handler setup includes comprehensive popup menu creation with on-demand menu
     * item generation and specialized action listeners for each customer function.
     * The event handling system ensures proper navigation coordination, interface lifecycle
     * management, and integration with the calling objects hierarchy.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Navigation integration includes intelligent duplicate prevention that examines current
     * interface state before initiating navigation transitions. Each navigation option
     * checks current frame title and only initiates navigation when required, preventing
     * unnecessary interface reloads and ensuring smooth customer workflow continuity.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Interface coordination includes proper window management for customer interface transitions.
     * The system manages frame visibility, size preservation, location maintenance, and
     * extended state coordination to ensure seamless transitions between customer interfaces
     * while maintaining optimal user experience and interface consistency.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Home navigation leverages the controller's goHome method to provide centralized
     * navigation logic that ensures customers can return to the main dashboard from
     * any customer interface context while maintaining proper state management and
     * resource coordination throughout navigation operations.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Flight search integration includes creating new {@link SearchFlightCustomerMainFrame}
     * instances with proper parameter passing for window dimensions, location, and extended
     * state preservation. The integration ensures that flight search interfaces maintain
     * visual continuity and optimal customer experience throughout search operations.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Booking management integration includes creating new {@link MyBookingsCustomerMainFrame}
     * instances with comprehensive parameter configuration including navigation context,
     * window state preservation, and menu-opened flag for proper interface behavior.
     * The integration enables immediate access to booking management capabilities.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Window management includes coordinating the visibility of parent windows during
     * navigation transitions, ensuring that only the active customer interface is visible
     * while maintaining proper navigation hierarchy and resource management throughout
     * customer workflow operations.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Layout integration includes proper component addition to the panel and immediate
     * visibility activation, ensuring that the customer menu is available for
     * interaction as soon as the panel is created and integrated within parent interfaces.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The constructor completes by establishing a fully functional customer menu
     * that provides centralized access to all primary customer functions while
     * maintaining integration with the broader customer interface ecosystem.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param callingObjects the list of parent objects in the application navigation hierarchy for proper navigation state management and resource coordination
     * @param controller the system controller providing access to customer functions, navigation logic, and specialized interface management capabilities
