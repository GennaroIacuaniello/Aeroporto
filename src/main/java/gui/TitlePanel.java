/**
 * Specialized title panel component providing consistent airport branding and system identification throughout the airport management system interfaces.
 * <p>
 * This class extends {@link JPanel} to provide a standardized title display component that delivers
 * consistent airport branding and system identification across all interfaces within the airport
 * management system. The TitlePanel serves as the primary branding component for interface headers,
 * offering professional HTML-formatted title presentation with centered alignment and optimal
 * visual hierarchy through an intuitive, reusable design optimized for airport management operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The TitlePanel class provides comprehensive title display functionality including:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>HTML Title Formatting:</strong> Professional HTML h1 title rendering with consistent typography and visual weight</li>
 *   <li><strong>Centered Alignment:</strong> Both horizontal and vertical center alignment for optimal visual presentation</li>
 *   <li><strong>Consistent Branding:</strong> Standardized airport identification display across all system interfaces</li>
 *   <li><strong>Layout Integration:</strong> GridBagLayout-based architecture for precise component positioning and responsive design</li>
 *   <li><strong>Automatic Visibility:</strong> Immediate visibility activation for seamless interface integration</li>
 *   <li><strong>Constraint Management:</strong> Integrated constraint utility for consistent layout behavior</li>
 *   <li><strong>Reusable Design:</strong> Parameterized title content for flexible usage across different interface contexts</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The interface is designed with visual consistency optimization, providing system users with:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Professional Branding:</strong> Clear airport system identification with standardized presentation</li>
 *   <li><strong>Visual Hierarchy:</strong> Prominent title display that establishes interface context and system identity</li>
 *   <li><strong>Consistent Experience:</strong> Uniform title presentation across all administrative and customer interfaces</li>
 *   <li><strong>Optimal Readability:</strong> HTML formatting with appropriate sizing for clear title identification</li>
 *   <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Adaptive layout that maintains proper presentation across different interface sizes</li>
 *   <li><strong>Immediate Recognition:</strong> Instant airport system identification for user orientation and context</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Panel architecture utilizes {@link GridBagLayout} for precise title positioning and optimal
 * space utilization. The layout ensures proper component organization with centered alignment
 * and responsive design principles that maintain visual consistency throughout different
 * interface contexts and window sizes within the airport management system.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Title formatting includes sophisticated HTML rendering with h1 tag utilization for
 * professional typography and optimal visual weight. The formatting provides:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>HTML Rendering:</strong> Native HTML h1 tag utilization for professional typography and consistent rendering</li>
 *   <li><strong>Dynamic Content:</strong> Parameterized title text for flexible branding across different system contexts</li>
 *   <li><strong>Professional Typography:</strong> Browser-quality HTML rendering with appropriate font sizing and weight</li>
 *   <li><strong>Consistent Presentation:</strong> Standardized title appearance regardless of interface context or usage scenario</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Alignment management provides comprehensive centering capabilities through both horizontal
 * and vertical alignment configuration. The system ensures that titles maintain proper
 * visual positioning regardless of panel size or interface context, supporting consistent
 * branding presentation throughout administrative and customer interface workflows.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Layout integration utilizes the {@link Constraints} utility for standardized GridBagConstraints
 * configuration, ensuring consistent component positioning and spacing throughout the airport
 * management system. The integration supports both horizontal and vertical expansion with
 * center anchoring for optimal title presentation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Visibility management includes automatic component visibility activation upon construction,
 * ensuring immediate title display without requiring additional configuration. The system
 * supports seamless integration within parent containers and maintains proper display
 * hierarchy throughout interface construction and presentation workflows.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class integrates seamlessly with the broader airport management system through comprehensive
 * usage across multiple interface types including {@link HomePageAdmin}, {@link HomePageCustomer},
 * {@link BookingPage}, and {@link MyBookingsCustomerMainFrame}. The integration provides
 * consistent branding while supporting interface-specific customization and context-appropriate
 * title display throughout administrative and customer workflows.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Constraint management utilizes the integrated {@link Constraints} utility to provide
 * standardized layout behavior with BOTH fill configuration, center anchoring, and appropriate
 * weight distribution. The management ensures optimal space utilization while maintaining
 * consistent visual presentation throughout different interface contexts.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Component lifecycle includes immediate construction-time configuration with automatic
 * layout setup, title rendering, and visibility activation. The lifecycle ensures that
 * TitlePanel instances are ready for immediate use upon instantiation without requiring
 * additional setup or configuration steps.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The TitlePanel serves as a critical branding component throughout the airport management
 * system ecosystem, providing essential visual identity and system recognition capabilities
 * while maintaining interface consistency, professional presentation, and optimal user
 * experience throughout administrative and customer interface workflows.
