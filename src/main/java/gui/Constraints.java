/**
 * Utility wrapper class for simplified GridBagConstraints configuration in GUI layouts.
 * <p>
 * This class provides a convenient interface for configuring {@link GridBagConstraints}
 * objects through multiple overloaded methods that handle common layout scenarios
 * within the airport management system's GUI components. It encapsulates the complexity
 * of GridBagLayout positioning while providing flexible configuration options for
 * different layout requirements.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Constraints class supports comprehensive layout configuration including:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Grid Positioning:</strong> Precise component placement through grid coordinates</li>
 *   <li><strong>Size Management:</strong> Component spanning across multiple grid cells</li>
 *   <li><strong>Fill Behavior:</strong> Component expansion control within allocated space</li>
 *   <li><strong>Padding Configuration:</strong> Internal and external spacing management</li>
 *   <li><strong>Anchor Positioning:</strong> Component alignment within grid cells</li>
 *   <li><strong>Weight Distribution:</strong> Space allocation priorities for resizing behavior</li>
 *   <li><strong>Margin Control:</strong> External spacing through Insets configuration</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The class provides multiple convenience methods with different parameter combinations
 * to accommodate various layout scenarios commonly encountered in the application's
 * GUI design. Each method delegates to a comprehensive configuration method while
 * providing sensible defaults for omitted parameters.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Default weight values are set to 0.01 for both horizontal and vertical directions,
 * providing minimal but non-zero weights that allow for predictable layout behavior
 * during container resizing operations. These defaults can be overridden through
 * method parameters when specific weight distribution is required.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The encapsulated {@link GridBagConstraints} object maintains all configuration
 * state and can be retrieved for direct use with layout managers. The wrapper
 * design ensures consistent constraint configuration across the application while
 * reducing boilerplate code in GUI component setup.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Usage patterns include component positioning in complex layouts such as booking
 * pages, passenger panels, search interfaces, and administrative control panels.
 * The class supports both simple positioning scenarios and complex multi-component
 * layouts requiring precise spacing and alignment control.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thread safety is not provided as GUI components are typically accessed from
 * the Event Dispatch Thread. Multiple Constraints instances should be used when
 * concurrent layout operations are required across different components.
