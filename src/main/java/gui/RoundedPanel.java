/**
 * Specialized JPanel component with rounded corners and customizable styling for the airport management system.
 * <p>
 * This class extends {@link JPanel} to provide enhanced visual appearance with rounded corner rendering,
 * customizable background colors, and configurable border styling. The RoundedPanel serves as a foundational
 * UI component throughout the airport management system, particularly integrated with the {@link FloatingMessage}
 * system to provide modern, visually appealing interface elements with professional rounded corner aesthetics.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The RoundedPanel class provides comprehensive visual enhancement functionality including:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Rounded Corner Rendering:</strong> Professional 30-pixel corner radius with anti-aliasing for smooth visual appearance</li>
 *   <li><strong>Custom Background Colors:</strong> Independent background color management with immediate visual updates</li>
 *   <li><strong>Configurable Border Styling:</strong> Customizable border colors with automatic repainting for dynamic styling</li>
 *   <li><strong>Layout Manager Integration:</strong> Full compatibility with standard Swing layout managers</li>
 *   <li><strong>Transparent Background Support:</strong> Opaque false configuration for optimal integration with parent containers</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The component is designed with modern UI principles, providing users with:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Professional Appearance:</strong> Rounded corners create modern, polished interface elements</li>
 *   <li><strong>Visual Consistency:</strong> Standardized corner radius and styling across all usage contexts</li>
 *   <li><strong>Enhanced Readability:</strong> Smooth edges reduce visual noise and improve content focus</li>
 *   <li><strong>Flexible Styling:</strong> Dynamic color changes support various message types and interface states</li>
 *   <li><strong>Seamless Integration:</strong> Transparent background enables proper layering with parent components</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Color management provides independent control over background and border colors through dedicated
 * field storage and override methods. The color system ensures immediate visual updates through
 * automatic repainting when colors are modified, maintaining real-time visual feedback for
 * dynamic interface elements and message type indicators.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Layout integration maintains full compatibility with standard Swing layout managers including
 * BorderLayout, GridBagLayout, and FlowLayout. The component accepts layout managers through
 * constructor parameters and properly delegates layout responsibilities to the parent JPanel
 * implementation while providing enhanced visual rendering.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * FloatingMessage integration provides the visual foundation for message notifications throughout
 * the airport management system. The rounded panel serves as the container for message content,
 * providing type-specific styling with customizable background and border colors that distinguish
 * different message categories including information, warnings, and error notifications.

     * <p>
     * This constructor initializes the rounded panel component with comprehensive visual
     * enhancements including rounded corner rendering, custom color management, and
     * transparent background configuration. The constructor establishes the foundation
     * for professional visual presentation while maintaining full compatibility with
     * standard Swing layout management systems.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The initialization process includes:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><strong>Parent Initialization:</strong> Standard JPanel construction with specified layout manager</li>
     *   <li><strong>Transparency Configuration:</strong> Opaque false setting for optimal parent container integration</li>
     *   <li><strong>Background Color Setup:</strong> Initial background color capture for independent color management</li>
     *   <li><strong>Border Color Initialization:</strong> Default border color setup based on foreground color</li>
     *   <li><strong>Visual Preparation:</strong> Component preparation for custom rounded corner rendering</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Parent initialization delegates to the superclass JPanel constructor with the
     * provided layout manager, ensuring proper layout management functionality while
     * preparing the component for enhanced visual rendering capabilities and
     * custom painting operations.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Transparency configuration sets the component as non-opaque (opaque = false),
     * enabling proper visual integration with parent containers and supporting
     * layered visual effects. The transparency setting ensures that rounded corners
     * blend naturally with parent component backgrounds.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Background color setup captures the initial background color from the parent
     * JPanel system and stores it in the custom backgroundColor field for independent
     * color management. This enables precise color control during custom painting
     * operations while maintaining compatibility with standard Swing color systems.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Border color initialization establishes the default border color based on the
     * component's foreground color, providing immediate visual definition while
     * enabling later customization through the setRoundBorderColor method for
     * type-specific styling and dynamic color management.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Visual preparation establishes the component foundation for custom rounded
     * corner rendering, ensuring that all necessary color and configuration elements
     * are properly initialized for immediate visual presentation upon component
     * display and integration within parent container layouts.

     * The painting process includes:

     *   <li><strong>Border Drawing:</strong> Outlined rounded rectangle creation with custom border color</li>

     * <p>
     * Corner radius configuration establishes a consistent 30-pixel radius for all rounded
     * corners, providing optimal visual balance between subtle styling and clear geometric
     * definition. The radius creates professional appearance without excessive visual
     * distraction while maintaining clear component boundaries.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Dimension calculation determines the current component width and height for precise
     * painting boundary establishment. The dimensions ensure accurate rounded rectangle
     * rendering that properly fills the component area while maintaining consistent
     * corner radius application across different component sizes.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Background rendering fills the rounded rectangle area with the custom backgroundColor,
     * providing complete visual coverage within the rounded boundaries. The background
     * rendering uses precise coordinate calculations (width-1, height-1) to ensure
     * proper edge alignment and visual consistency.

     * Border drawing creates the rounded rectangle outline using the custom roundBorderColor,

     * visual integration and professional appearance.
