     * Filter panel creation utilizes specialized methods {@link #createFlightFilterPanel()} and
     * {@link #createPassengerFilterPanel()} to establish comprehensive input interfaces for each
     * search mode. The panels are created with complete functionality but initially hidden to
     * provide clean interface presentation before user selection.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Dynamic visibility management includes initial configuration where both filter panels are
     * set to invisible, providing a clean initial interface state. The panels are positioned
     * using overlapping layout constraints, enabling efficient space utilization while maintaining
     * proper visual presentation when activated through user interaction.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Event handler integration includes comprehensive ActionListener implementation for both
     * filter mode buttons that provides:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><strong>Flight Button Handler:</strong> Sets activeFilter to "FLIGHT", shows flight filter panel, hides passenger panel</li>
     *   <li><strong>Passenger Button Handler:</strong> Sets activeFilter to "PASSENGER", shows passenger filter panel, hides flight panel</li>
     *   <li><strong>Interface Updates:</strong> Automatic panel revalidation and repainting for smooth visual transitions</li>
     *   <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Active filter mode tracking for proper search operation routing</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The flight button event handler configures the interface for flight-based booking searches
     * by updating the activeFilter state variable, managing panel visibility for flight-specific
     * input fields, and triggering interface updates to ensure immediate visual feedback for
     * user selection and proper interface state presentation.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The passenger button event handler configures the interface for passenger-based booking
     * searches by updating the activeFilter state variable, managing panel visibility for
     * passenger-specific input fields, and ensuring proper interface coordination for passenger
     * information-based search operations throughout the booking management workflow.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Layout management utilizes precise GridBagConstraints configuration through the constraints
     * utility to ensure optimal component positioning. The button panel is positioned at the top
     * with horizontal expansion and appropriate bottom margin (35 pixels), while filter panels
     * are positioned below with overlapping constraints for efficient space utilization.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Interface state management ensures that only one filter panel is visible at any time,
     * providing clean user experience and preventing interface confusion. The dynamic switching
     * includes proper revalidation and repainting to ensure smooth visual transitions and
     * immediate user feedback during filter mode selection.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The method returns a fully configured main panel ready for integration within the broader
     * search interface, providing comprehensive dual-mode filtering capabilities with professional
     * visual presentation and seamless user interaction throughout booking search operations.

    /**
     * Creates and configures the comprehensive flight filter panel with advanced flight search criteria and date/time range selection.
     * <p>
     * This private method establishes the specialized flight filtering interface that enables customers
     * to search for bookings using flight-specific criteria including origin/destination cities, date
     * ranges, and time ranges. The method creates a sophisticated dual-column layout with comprehensive
     * input validation support, professional styling, and optimal space utilization for enhanced user
     * experience during flight-based booking search operations.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The flight filter panel creation process includes:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><strong>Container Architecture:</strong> Dual-column layout with GridLayout container and GridBagLayout panels</li>
     *   <li><strong>Origin/Destination Fields:</strong> City input fields with professional styling and validation integration</li>
     *   <li><strong>Date Range Selection:</strong> DatePicker components with range validation and user-friendly interface</li>
     *   <li><strong>Time Range Selection:</strong> TimePicker components with time range validation and precise selection</li>
     *   <li><strong>Visual Organization:</strong> Label styling, separator elements, and optimal spacing for professional presentation</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Container architecture utilizes a sophisticated layout system with a main GridLayout container
     * (1 row, 2 columns, 40-pixel gap) that houses left and right panels configured with GridBagLayout
     * for precise component positioning. All panels use transparent backgrounds to maintain visual
     * integration with the parent container and overall interface design consistency.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Origin/destination fields include professionally styled text fields with appropriate sizing
     * (15 characters) and Segoe UI font configuration (plain, 16pt) for optimal readability. The
     * left panel houses the "Da:" (From) field while the right panel contains the "A:" (To) field,
     * providing intuitive left-to-right flight route specification that matches natural user expectations.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Date range selection utilizes {@link DatePicker} components with custom font configuration
     * (Segoe UI, plain, 14pt) for the date text fields. The date pickers are positioned with a
     * visual separator ("--") between them to clearly indicate range specification, and include
     * proper constraint configuration for optimal space distribution (0.5f weight each) within
     * the available layout space.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Time range selection employs {@link TimePicker} components with matching font configuration
     * and layout principles as the date range selection. The time pickers enable precise time
     * specification for flight filtering and include visual separation with consistent spacing
     * and alignment throughout the interface for professional presentation.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Visual organization includes comprehensive label styling through {@link #setLabelApperance(JLabel)}
     * for consistent typography and professional appearance. Labels include Italian localization:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><strong>"Da:" and "A:":</strong> Origin and destination city labels with clear identification</li>
     *   <li><strong>"Range date:":</strong> Date range section label for temporal filtering</li>
     *   <li><strong>"Fascia oraria:":</strong> Time range section label for temporal precision</li>
     *   <li><strong>"--" Separators:</strong> Visual separators between range components for clarity</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Layout management utilizes precise GridBagConstraints configuration through the constraints
     * utility to ensure optimal component positioning and spacing. The layout includes:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><strong>Left Panel Layout:</strong> Origin field and date range components with proper alignment</li>
     *   <li><strong>Right Panel Layout:</strong> Destination field and time range components with consistent spacing</li>
     *   <li><strong>Spacing Management:</strong> 30-pixel bottom margins for visual separation between sections</li>
     *   <li><strong>Alignment Control:</strong> LINE_END and LINE_START alignment for optimal visual organization</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Component positioning ensures that labels are right-aligned (LINE_END) for clean visual
     * organization, while input fields are left-aligned (LINE_START) with horizontal expansion
     * for optimal space utilization. Separators are center-aligned to provide clear visual
     * indication of range relationships between paired components.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The method integrates field initialization with proper styling and positioning to create
     * a comprehensive flight filtering interface that supports advanced search criteria specification
     * while maintaining professional visual presentation and intuitive user interaction patterns
     * throughout flight-based booking search operations.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Validation integration is prepared through proper field configuration and styling that
     * supports the comprehensive input validation implemented in {@link #filteredFlightSearch}
     * for city specification consistency, date range logic, and time range validation throughout
     * the booking search workflow.
