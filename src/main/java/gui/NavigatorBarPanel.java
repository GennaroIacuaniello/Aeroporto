/**
 * Navigation bar panel providing system-wide navigation controls for the airport management system.
 * <p>
 * This class extends {@link JPanel} to provide a comprehensive navigation interface that enables
 * users to navigate between different areas of the airport management system while maintaining
 * proper navigation state and resource management. The panel offers essential navigation functions
 * including home navigation and back navigation through an intuitive button-based interface
 * optimized for both customer and administrative workflows.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Navigation state management includes intelligent duplicate prevention that examines current
 * interface state before initiating navigation transitions. The home navigation checks current
 * frame titles to prevent unnecessary reloads when users are already at the home interface,
 * ensuring smooth user experience and optimal system performance.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Home navigation functionality provides users with immediate access to the main dashboard
 * from any location within the application. The navigation includes intelligent state checking
 * to prevent redundant home navigation when users are already at the home interface,
 * enhancing user experience and system efficiency.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Back navigation implementation enables users to return to previously visited interfaces
 * through the application navigation hierarchy. The back functionality integrates with the
 * calling objects system to provide proper navigation state management and resource cleanup
 * during backward navigation operations.
