/**
 * Utility class for managing automated window disposal with fade-out animation effects.
 * <p>
 * This class provides timed disposal functionality for {@link JWindow} components, implementing
 * a sophisticated fade-out animation sequence that includes visibility delay, gradual opacity
 * reduction, and automatic window disposal. It is primarily designed for use with temporary
 * notification windows such as {@link FloatingMessage} components that require automatic
 * cleanup after a specified duration.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The DisposeTimers class implements comprehensive timed disposal operations including:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Visibility Duration Control:</strong> Maintains full visibility for a specified period</li>
 *   <li><strong>Fade-out Animation:</strong> Gradual opacity reduction for smooth visual transition</li>
 *   <li><strong>Automatic Disposal:</strong> Complete window cleanup and resource deallocation</li>
 *   <li><strong>Timer Coordination:</strong> Synchronized timer management for sequential animation phases</li>
 *   <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Proper cleanup of all timer resources and window references</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The disposal process follows a three-phase animation sequence:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>Visibility Phase (1500ms):</strong> Window remains fully visible at original opacity</li>
 *   <li><strong>Fade-out Phase (1000ms):</strong> Gradual opacity reduction from current value to 0.0</li>
 *   <li><strong>Disposal Phase:</strong> Complete window disposal and timer cleanup</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Timer coordination ensures smooth transitions between animation phases with proper resource
 * management throughout the disposal lifecycle. Each timer is configured with appropriate
 * repeat settings and cleanup procedures to prevent resource leaks and ensure complete
 * disposal completion.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The fade-out animation uses incremental opacity reduction (0.01 per 10ms interval) to
 * create smooth visual transitions that enhance user experience for temporary notification
 * displays. The animation respects the window's current opacity level, accommodating
 * scenarios where windows may have been created with non-standard opacity values.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Integration with {@link FloatingMessage} components enables automatic disposal of temporary
 * notification windows without requiring manual cleanup by calling code. This reduces
 * complexity in notification management while ensuring proper resource cleanup and
 * preventing window accumulation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class is designed as a one-time use utility where each instance manages the disposal
 * of a single window. Multiple DisposeTimers instances should be created for managing
 * multiple windows requiring timed disposal functionality.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thread safety is provided through Swing's Event Dispatch Thread execution model, as
 * all timer operations execute on the EDT. The class should only be instantiated and
 * used from the Event Dispatch Thread to maintain proper Swing threading compliance.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Performance considerations include minimal resource overhead through efficient timer
 * management and automatic cleanup procedures that prevent timer accumulation and
 * memory leaks during extended application operation.

public class DisposeTimers {

    /**
     * Timer responsible for gradual opacity reduction during the fade-out animation phase.
     * <p>
     * This timer executes at 10-millisecond intervals during the fade-out phase, reducing
     * the window's opacity by 0.01 per execution until the window reaches complete
     * transparency (opacity 0.0). The timer is configured with repeat enabled to support
     * continuous opacity reduction throughout the fade-out duration.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The timer's action listener implements conditional opacity reduction that checks
     * the current opacity level and applies appropriate reduction or sets final
     * transparency based on the current opacity value. This ensures smooth animation
     * progression regardless of the window's initial opacity setting.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Timer lifecycle management includes automatic termination when the fade-out
     * animation completes, with proper cleanup coordination through the disposal
     * timer to ensure complete resource deallocation.

    /**
     * Constructs a new DisposeTimers instance for managing automated window disposal with fade-out animation.
     * <p>
     * This constructor initializes the complete timed disposal system for the specified window,
     * creating and configuring all necessary timers for the three-phase disposal sequence.
     * The constructor immediately starts the disposal process, beginning with the visibility
     * phase and automatically progressing through fade-out and disposal phases.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The initialization process establishes:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><strong>Fade-out Timer:</strong> Configured for 10ms intervals with opacity reduction logic</li>
     *   <li><strong>Start Delay Timer:</strong> 1500ms single-execution timer to initiate fade-out phase</li>
     *   <li><strong>Disposal Timer:</strong> 2500ms single-execution timer for complete window cleanup</li>
     *   <li><strong>Timer Coordination:</strong> Proper sequencing and resource management between phases</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The fade-out timer implements incremental opacity reduction logic that decreases
     * window opacity by 0.01 per execution cycle. The timer continues execution until
     * the window reaches complete transparency (opacity â‰¤ 0.01), at which point the
     * opacity is set to 0.0 for complete invisibility.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Start delay timer management provides the initial visibility duration (1500ms)
     * before beginning the fade-out animation. This timer executes once and automatically
     * initiates the fade-out phase by starting the opacity reduction timer while
     * stopping itself to prevent resource accumulation.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Disposal timer coordination ensures complete window cleanup after the total
     * disposal duration (2500ms). This timer handles final window disposal through
     * the dispose() method and performs comprehensive cleanup of all timer resources
     * including stopping active timers and disabling repeat functionality.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Timer activation sequence immediately starts both the disposal timer and start
     * delay timer, initiating the complete disposal process. The timers execute
     * independently but coordinate through their action listeners to ensure proper
     * sequence progression and resource management.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Resource management throughout the disposal process ensures that all timer
     * references are properly cleaned up, preventing memory leaks and ensuring
     * complete disposal of both the target window and the disposal management
     * infrastructure.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The constructor completes immediately after timer initialization and activation,
     * with all subsequent disposal operations handled asynchronously through the
     * timer execution framework. This ensures non-blocking disposal initiation
     * while maintaining complete automation of the disposal process.
     * </p>
