 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Menu architecture utilizes a dynamic popup menu system that creates menu items on-demand,
 * ensuring optimal memory usage and providing flexibility for future administrative function
 * additions. The menu supports three primary administrative functions: home navigation,
 * lost luggage management, and flight creation operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Navigation functionality includes intelligent duplicate prevention that checks current interface
 * state before initiating navigation transitions. This prevents unnecessary interface reloads
 * and ensures smooth administrative workflow continuity throughout system operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Lost luggage integration provides direct access to the {@link LostLuggageDialog} component,
 * enabling administrators to quickly access comprehensive lost luggage management capabilities
 * including luggage tracking, recovery operations, and customer service coordination from
 * any administrative interface context.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Flight operations integration includes access to the {@link AddNewFlightDialog} component
 * for comprehensive flight creation and configuration capabilities. This integration enables
 * administrators to quickly add new flights to the system with complete operational parameters
 * and schedule coordination directly from the administrative menu.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Error handling integration includes proper error button management through controller
 * coordination, ensuring that administrative operations maintain proper error state tracking
 * and user feedback throughout dialog-based administrative workflows and system interactions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The panel integrates seamlessly with the broader administrative interface ecosystem including
 * {@link HomePageAdmin}, {@link NavigatorBarPanel}, and other administrative components while
 * maintaining clean separation of concerns and reusable design patterns.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Visual design maintains consistency with the overall airport management system aesthetic
 * through standardized button styling, popup menu presentation, and layout integration that
 * supports both standalone operation and integration within larger administrative interfaces.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Resource management follows standard Swing component lifecycle patterns with proper component
 * initialization, event handler setup, and memory-efficient popup menu creation that supports
 * extended administrative sessions without performance degradation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class serves as a primary navigation hub for administrative operations, providing
 * consistent access patterns and interface behavior that support efficient administrative
 * workflows and operational continuity throughout the airport management system.

    /**
     * Constructs a new MenuPanelAdmin with comprehensive administrative menu functionality.
     * <p>
     * This constructor initializes the complete administrative menu interface by creating
     * the menu button, configuring available administrative options, and establishing
     * comprehensive event handling for all administrative functions. The constructor
     * creates a fully functional administrative menu ready for immediate use with
     * integrated navigation, dialog management, and system coordination capabilities.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The initialization process includes:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><strong>Menu Button Creation:</strong> Primary menu button with Italian "Menù" label for administrative access</li>
     *   <li><strong>Option Configuration:</strong> Dynamic list of administrative functions including navigation and specialized tools</li>
     *   <li><strong>Event Handler Setup:</strong> Comprehensive popup menu creation and item selection handling</li>
     *   <li><strong>Navigation Integration:</strong> Intelligent navigation with duplicate prevention and state management</li>
     *   <li><strong>Dialog Coordination:</strong> Seamless integration with specialized administrative dialogs</li>
     *   <li><strong>Layout Integration:</strong> Proper panel integration and component visibility management</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Menu button creation establishes the primary user interaction point with Italian
     * localization ("Menù") for administrative interface consistency. The button serves
     * as the trigger for the dynamic popup menu system and maintains standard Swing
     * button behavior and styling throughout administrative operations.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Option configuration includes creating a dynamic list of administrative functions:
     * "Home" for system navigation, "Bagagli smarriti" (Lost Luggage) for luggage management,
     * and "Aggiungi nuovo volo" (Add New Flight) for flight operations. The dynamic list
     * architecture supports future expansion and modification of administrative functions.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Event handler setup includes comprehensive popup menu creation with on-demand menu
     * item generation and specialized action listeners for each administrative function.
     * The event handling system ensures proper navigation coordination, dialog lifecycle
     * management, and integration with the calling objects hierarchy.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Navigation integration includes intelligent duplicate prevention that examines current
     * interface state before initiating navigation transitions. The "Home" navigation
     * checks current frame title and only initiates navigation when required, preventing
     * unnecessary interface reloads and ensuring smooth administrative workflow continuity.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Dialog coordination includes proper parent window detection and modal dialog creation
     * for both lost luggage management and flight creation operations. The coordination
     * ensures that dialogs maintain proper window relationships and resource management
     * throughout administrative workflows.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Lost luggage dialog integration includes error button management through controller
     * coordination and proper parent window association for modal dialog behavior. The
     * integration enables immediate access to comprehensive lost luggage management
     * capabilities from any administrative interface context.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Flight creation dialog integration includes proper owner window detection and
     * dialog lifecycle management for comprehensive flight creation capabilities. The
     * integration supports immediate flight addition with complete operational parameter
     * configuration directly from the administrative menu.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Layout integration includes proper component addition to the panel and immediate
     * visibility activation, ensuring that the administrative menu is available for
     * interaction as soon as the panel is created and integrated within parent interfaces.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The constructor completes by establishing a fully functional administrative menu
     * that provides centralized access to all primary administrative functions while
     * maintaining integration with the broader administrative interface ecosystem.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param callingObjects the list of parent objects in the application navigation hierarchy for proper navigation state management and resource coordination
     * @param controller the system controller providing access to administrative functions, navigation logic, and specialized dialog management capabilities
